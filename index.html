<h1 style="text-align:center"> About me</h1>
<p> My name is Ellie Feighery. I am a qualified Beauty Therapist in Aesthetic
treatments and Makeup Artist. I have been working on counter and freelancing as a makeup
artist for almost 3 years.</p> 

<img src="Ellie.jpg" alt="Picture of the client" class="Picture">

<p>I worked for Inglot in the Inglot Pro Store where I was a makeup artist and completed
the roles of Product Specialist and In-Store Trainer. I received Inglot training in makeup
artistry while completing my college qualification. I have also worked for the company Estee
Lauder under the brand Bobbi Brown where I trained in brows and worked as an on-counter
Brow Artist.</p>


<p> I also completed brand training and Brow Artist training in the London Bobbi Brown Academy.
I was involved in many in-house courses for Inglot in the aforementioned Inglot Pro Store and
became passionate about teaching. I also have taught many masterclasses to colleges and the general
public. I have also conducted masterclasses for VIP Magazine for new product launches.

I have always had a passion for makeup, and really enjoy making people feel good or teaching them a
new trick to add to their routines.</p>
